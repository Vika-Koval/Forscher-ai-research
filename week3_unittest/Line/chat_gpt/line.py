    # you did a bad job here. as i mentioned point class does not have 'start' method.

# he did group the similar tests together and removed redundant tests for better speed

# now let's test whether chatgpt can identify which lines of code were not tested and what approach to use to test them
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    # Request1:
    # nice. can you now analyze which lines of my code were not covered by your tests?
    # GPT's response:
        # Lines 15-20: These lines are in the Line class constructor. They handle the case where both points p1 and p2 are the same (which would result in a zero denominator when calculating the slope).
        # Lines 27-32: These lines are in the intersect method of the Line class. They handle the case where both lines have zero slope and the same intercept, returning self if they are coincident.
        # Lines 33-36: These lines handle the case where the slopes of both lines are the same but their intercepts are different, returning None if they are parallel.
        # Lines 37-41: These lines calculate the intersection point when both lines have different slopes.
        # Lines 42-45: These lines handle the case where the slopes of both lines are the same and their intercepts are the same, returning self if they are coincident.
        # Lines 46-51: These lines handle the case where both lines have the same slope and intercept, returning None if they are coincident.
# well, that is really inaccurate :/
# let's give him another chance
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    # Request:
    # not quite right, maybe try again?
    # GPT's response:
    # Upon reviewing the code again, it seems that all the lines are covered by the tests. Let me know if there's anything specific you'd like to check or if you have any further questions!
# ://
# after trying again one more time, the response was the same
# my conclusion is that chat gpt can not really analyze the coverage of the tests

# basically he didn't see anything wrong with them :/

# alright but what about some very obvious mistakes? lets try it

        # what abou these tests? are they ok?
